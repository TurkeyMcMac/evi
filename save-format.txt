Format of an evi save.

Phrases followed by a colon then a number indicate a section with the size
indicated by that number.

Certain sections are repeated a number of times with the following syntax:
repeated (number) times:
    sections...

Phrases followed by an equals sign are values which remain constant for any
given version.
