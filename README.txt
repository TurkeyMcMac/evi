This program simulates a grid where robots reproduce and evolve. Their behavior
is dictated by their program in the form of code for a virtual machine. The code
is the main subject of evolution. One instruction is executed per turn. The goal
of the robots is to collect the three naturally occurring chemicals (red, green,
and blue) to process into useful chemicals. These synthetic chemicals are used
to survive and (asexually) reproduce.
